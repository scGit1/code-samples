This directory completes the gradual deformation algorithm performed
to invert for a subsurface velocity field. Statistical model Realizations
were generated using Stanford Geostatistical Modeling Sorftware (SGeMS).
These realizations are transformed to data space and converted to a .npy
by running the script './sc_GradDef/svReal.py'. The algorithm is completed 
by next running './sc_GradDef/realDepth.py'.
