see '/gradual_deformation/README.txt

The script 'fitter.py' implements the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to curve fit.

The second script 'wave2d.py' is a script that implements a numerical integration technique to propagate a wavefield.

The third file 'ionfinder.xlsx' is a spreadsheet used to search for observed transitions in ions.
